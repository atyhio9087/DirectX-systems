A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, crypto, or coin is a digital 
currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a 
computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such 
as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. 
We define a any cryptocurrency as a chain of digital signatures. Each 
owner transfers it to the next by digitally signing a hash of the 
previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and 
adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures 
to verify the chain of ownership.
Our web application helps transfer Ethereum to another wallet on 
the ERC20 network in using minimal gas fees. We show all the 
transactions on the blockchain using a GIFHY Api that takes a tag and 
a message.
